    "## Reminders on PyTorch\n",
    "[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) is a standard library to build and train neural networks. Two essential components are auto-differentiation and GPU support with parallelization of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [`torch.Tensor`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html) object is very similar to a `numpy.array`, and most existing operations in numpy have identical equivalent in PyTorch. However behaviors can be slightly different so always check the documentation ! Using built-in PyTorch functions instead of numpy enables automatic gradient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that PyTorch operations are built to be significantly accelerated on GPU by using parallel computing. This implies that the first dimension of a `torch.Tensor` is most often interpreted as the batch dimension and operations are applied *in parallel* to each element of the batch **independently**.\n",
    "For instance, given a tensor `A` of size `[M,N]` and a tensor `X` of size `[B,N,P]`, the output of `A @ X` will be of size `[B,M,P]`, where the matrix multiplication by `A` is applied to each of the `X[i]` in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DiffusionNet, some blocks (*eg* the diffusion block) can be applied to multiple surfaces in parallel so batches are made of surfaces. On the contrary the MLP or gradient features blocks are applied to each vertex independantly so the batches are made of vertices. This will require some particular care when coding."

The objective is to understand the utility of different components of DiffusionNet block built during this session. More specifically, we will make one change at a time to the above network to understand how the segmentation accuracy varies.\n",

    "\n",

    "The first two question consists of reimplementing `DiffusionNet` module such that it incorporates aforementioned changes into the blocks. Either create a new class or add arguments which you'll use in the `model_cfg` dictionary.\n",
