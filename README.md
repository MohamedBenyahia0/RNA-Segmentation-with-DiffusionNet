**RNA Segmentation with DiffusionNet**

Developed RNA segmentation model based on DiffusionNet from the paper DiffusionNet : Discretization Agnostic Learning on Surfaces
**Final Achieved Validation Accuracy : 72.18 %**

**Remark : To save time and allow you to see the results immediately, I have already completed the model training. 
To directly test the model and visualize the results without retraining, simply upload the models folder, which contains the final checkpoints, to your Drive. 
This will allow you to load the pretrained model and proceed directly with testing .**
